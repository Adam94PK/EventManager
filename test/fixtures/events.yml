# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one: 
  name: Event 1
  user: user1
  main_page_id: nil
#
two: 
  name: Event 2
  user: user2
  main_page_id: nil
#  column: value
